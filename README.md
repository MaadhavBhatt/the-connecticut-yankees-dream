# The Connecticut Yankee's Dream

In an 1889 historical novel [A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court) by Mark Twain, a 19th-century American engineer named Hank Morgan is transported back in time to the court of King Arthur. Using his knowledge of modern technology and science, Hank attempts to modernize the medieval society and bring about progress.

What if Hank Morgan was transported to the future? The Connecticut Yankee's Dream is the optimal tool for such a Hank Morgan. This website contains a summary of key geopolitical events from the present day, providing insights and context that could help him navigate and influence the future world he finds himself in.

The Connecticut Yankee's Dream is a fun, engaging, and community-driven way to document history as it unfolds around us.
